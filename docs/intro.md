# Basics of scripting in ROBLOX Studio and TRIA.os

Welcome to the scripting documentation of TRIA.os!<br></br>
By default we assume you have some knowledge of general scripting in ROBLOX Studio so the documents will sound a bit nerdy, but if you don't have the neccessary information, you can consult this page.

## Booleans

Boolean is an easy-to-understand data type which one has two values: `true` or `false`. Think of it like a light switch, there are only two states a light bulb can be which is on or off.<br></br>
In [conditional statements](https://create.roblox.com/docs/scripting/luau/control-structures#if-statements), if a boolean isn't `false` or `nil`, Luau (the scripting language used for Studio) will evaluates the boolean as `true`.<br></br>

## Strings

String is a data type used to store text data, such as letters, numbers and symbols.
